def load_big_patch(folder, fname, patch_size=256, overlap=0):
    """
    Given a tile filename (x_y.jpg), load the tile with its neighbors 
    to build a larger patch including overlap context.

    Parameters
    ----------
    folder : str
        Path to folder containing tiles.
    fname : str
        Tile filename like "12_8.jpg".
    patch_size : int
        Size of each tile (default 256).
    overlap : int
        Context overlap (default 0).
        Example: overlap=64 â†’ returns (256+2*64)x(256+2*64) patch.

    Returns
    -------
    big_patch : np.ndarray
        Image containing the tile + context.
    center_coords : tuple
        (row_start, row_end, col_start, col_end) for the center tile inside big_patch.
